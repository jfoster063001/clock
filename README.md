# clock
# This project is a clock that will tell time for you in regular 12 hour time and also 24 hour format. It also has a way to update the time for different time zones and
# this will solve the problem of people not knowing the time and showing up late.

# I feel like I made the presentation and cleaness of the actual output of the clock very well and it looks nice.

# I think I could improve the code in the way it flashes a little bit when it updates the time, im sure there is a way to make that cleaner.

# The hardest part for me was finding a way to add time and also constantly update the clock and I had to figure out a way to have two processes going at the same time
# I had to use my resources of the internet and figure out how to multithread to get it to work which if I every get stuck I can use that resource.

# I think the skills that will transfer over is using multithreading in other projects. That could be very useful in more complicated projects that I may have in the
# future

# This code is maintainable because there are all different specific functions that make the program very readable and adaptable if you ever needed to change an 
# aspect of the clock. This is also very readable because it is all commentated out so its east to tell whats going on.
